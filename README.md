## CRUD Operations Overview

### Create
When users register via the **Sign-Up** button, inputs are validated and a new user is created using `createUserWithEmailAndPassword()` from Firebase Authentication. Upon success, extra details like name and phone number are stored in **Firestore**.

### Read
The `loadBabies()` function retrieves a list of registered babies for the user, displaying each baby in a card with their name, age, gender, and ID. It auto-refreshes on app launch or when changes occur.

### Update
In the profile section, the `onViewCreated()` method captures profile edits. After clicking "Save", the data is updated in **Firestore**, with confirmation or error messages shown based on the result.

### Delete
When users choose to delete their account, a confirmation dialog appears. If confirmed, the app deletes the userâ€™s **Firestore** document and **Firebase Auth** account. Users are then signed out and redirected to the login screen.
